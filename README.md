## üîß Getting Started

### Inference
To perform segmentation on a sample image, run:
```bash
python inference_demo.py -p data_demo/images/amos_0004_75.png
```

### Inference with Uncertainty Visualization
To visualize both the segmentation and its uncertainty map, run:
```bash
python inference_demo.py -p data_demo/images/amos_0004_75.png -u True
```
